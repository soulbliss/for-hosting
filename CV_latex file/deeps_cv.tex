\hfill {\small{{\textbf{[March '19 - April '19]}}\/}}
\begin{itemize*}

  \setlength{\itemsep}{.00pt}
      \item \textbf{Abstract} Build an economical portable face detection mechanism using machine learning and image processing algorithms.
      \item Implemented a face detection algorithm using haar-cascades and LBPHFacerecognizer module, loaded on top of Raspberry Pi 3 to solve the problem statement.
	  \item Results - The algorithm was trained to recognize 4 faces, with an accuracy of 70\% and a tweak on reduction in input stream resolution size to increase speed by 2x, to improve performance despite dataset limitations.
\end{itemize*}

{(Guide : Prof. Shashank Pansari, MIT Manipal)} \hfill {\small{{\textbf{[Aug '17 - Sep '17]}}\/}}
\begin{itemize*}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{.00pt}
      \item \textbf{Abstract}: The effect of evaporator temperature on the coefficient of performance of a heat pump is to be visualized.
      \item  A python script is used to achieve the visual plots by using matplotlib and extracting data from the available dataset from an excel file.
The output is displayed with the help of an interactive GUI interface using WX module
and tkinter.
	  \item Results - The plotted output graphs indicated that as the temperature increased the COP also increases.
